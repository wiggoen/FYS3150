FYS3150/FYS4150 - Project 3 class example
============
This is a simple example implementing most classes you need in order to do project 3 in FYS3150/FYS4150. 

You will need to implement the force calculation in solarsystem.cpp and a new class, the Velocity verlet integrator.

By default, the example prints all positions every timestep to a file called positions.xyz. You can visualize this by using i.e. [Ovito](http://ovito.org/).

Good luck :D
