FYS3150/FYS4150 - Project 4 Studies of phase transitions in magnetic systems
============

Program to solve the two-dimensional Ising model with zero external field.
* The coupling constant is J = 1. 
* Boltzmann's constant is k = 1. 
* Temperature has dimension energy.
* Metroplis sampling and periodic boundary conditions is used.

The initial system has a random spin matrix. If you want to use the ground state, 
comment and uncomment the right line in the 'initialize()' funtion in System.cpp.

But I've struggled with the code a lot. But since the deadline approches, I have to write the report.
