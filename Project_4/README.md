FYS3150/FYS4150 - Project 4 Studies of phase transitions in magnetic systems
============

Program to solve the two-dimensional Ising model with zero external field.
The coupling constant is J = 1 and Boltzmann's constant k = 1. 
Temperature has dimension energy.
Metroplis sampling and periodic boundary conditions is used.
